Landscape in the Early Morning

    By Alfred Lichtenstein
 The air is gray.    Who knows something good for soot?
    Next to an ox grazing on the ground
    Stands an astonished deeply serious mountaineer.
    Soon there is a powerful downpour of rain.
    A young boy who is pissing on a meadow
    Will be the source of a small river.
    What should one do when nature calls!
    Be natural.    Be yourself.
    A poet roams around in the world,
    Observes for himself the orderly flow of traffic
    And rejoices about sky, field, and dung.
    Ah, and he takes careful notice of everything.
    Then he climbs a high mountain
    Which happens to be close by.
